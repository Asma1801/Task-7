# Task-7 KNN/
This program performs exploratory data analysis on the dataset using Python Pandas, including dropping irrelevant fields for predicted values, and standardization of each attribute.

Following data cleaning, two Scikit-Learn KNN models are created for two different distance metrics: Square Euclidean and Manhattan distance. 

The performance of the two models using different distance metrics is compared in terms of accuracy to the test data and Scikit-Learn Classification Report.
